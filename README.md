# Load-Prediction-for-Texas-Markets

In this lab, I train a neural network to predict 24-hour aggregate load from Texas for a day using history of demands. The goals for this lab are to:
1. Load the data and analyze to find patterns.
2. Define a neural network for the regression. Try different number of layers, learning rates, linear v/s nonlinear regression, activation functions, number of epochs, etc.
3. Explore the effects of wind energy on load prediction.
